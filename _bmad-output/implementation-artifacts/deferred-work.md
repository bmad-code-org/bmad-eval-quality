# Deferred work

Story 2.2 carried two items, both closed on 2026-08-21 by
`spec-harden-seal-exclusion-guarantee.md`. The fixes and their reasoning live
in `spec-2-2-brief-assembly-exclusions-and-canonical-ordering.md`'s Spec
Change Log: the module-boundary guard's file list and `seal()`'s missing
runtime self-validation.

Story 2.1 carried one item, closed on 2026-08-21: `groupResolvedTargets`'s chain-collapse logic
dropped legal disjoint pairings for after-chains of four or more steps. The fix and its reasoning
live in `2-1-the-direction-prose-generator.md`'s Decision log.

Epic 1 itself closed with an empty ledger. Four items were carried here and all four were closed on
2026-08-20. Each one's reasoning lives with the work rather than in this file, which is a queue and not
a record:

- Shareable HTML links usable without repository access, and validation that the export is current
  and canonical: `spec-condense-readme.md`, "Follow-up hardening, closed 2026-08-20".
- Digest-path throughput over large observation and score arrays: story 1.2, Completion Notes
  decision 25. Measured, and closed with no code change.
- Amortising the generated mutant corpus: story 1.5, Review Findings. Cached, and the cost claim
  corrected by measurement.

## How to use this file

An entry belongs here only when the work cannot be done in the pass that found it and the decision
to defer is deliberate. Give it a `source_spec`, a one-line `summary`, and the `evidence` a later
reader needs to pick it up cold. When it is done, delete the entry itself; a terse pointer to where
the outcome and reasoning live (the source spec) may stay in the closure prose above, the way every
closure on record here already does it, so a later reader is not left to guess what was once open.
The rule is about the entry, not about erasing that something was once open.
